### About

My interests are broad and often chaotic. I'm generally drawn to patterns, simple ideas, and solving problems that feel just a bit out of reach.
This site is a place Iâ€™ll share ideas, projects or anything I find interesting: code, designs, thoughts, maybe some photos, maybe some noise.
